// ### HOW TO EDIT SPEAKERS ###
//
// 1. All speaker information is stored in this list called `speakerData`.
// 2. Each speaker is an object inside curly braces `{}`, separated by a comma.
// 3. To ADD a new speaker, copy an existing `{...},` block and paste it into the correct section.
// 4. To EDIT a speaker, just change the text in the quotes for that speaker.
// 5. To use a BLANK image, use "images/speakers/placeholder.jpg".
// 6. The `lineup` property determines which section the speaker appears in. Use one of these:
//    '2025', '2024', '2023', 'spring2023'
